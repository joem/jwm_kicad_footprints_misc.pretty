jwm_kicad_footprints_misc.pretty
================================

This is a collection of miscellaneous footprints for [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org). Currently, this is my only custom footprints library, but it's also a holding library before I can break footprints out into separate specialized libraries.

Footprints included in this library:

Footprint | Description
--------- | -----------
C_Disc_D5.0mm_W2.5mm_P2.50mm_LZX | a small capacitor footprint made to look how they do on LZX Cadet PCBs
D_P7.62mm_Horizontal_LZX | a diode footprint made to look how they do on LZX Cadet PCBs
IDC-Header_2x05_P2.54mm_Vertical_EurorackPower | a 2x5 IDC header with Eurorack power annotations
IDC-Header_2x05_P2.54mm_Vertical_EurorackPower2 | a 2x5 IDC header with Eurorack power annotations
IDC-Header_2x08_P2.54mm_Vertical_EurorackPower | a 2x8 IDC header with Eurorack power annotations
IDC-Header_2x08_P2.54mm_Vertical_EurorackPower2 | a 2x8 IDC header with Eurorack power annotations
Jack_3.5mm_QingPu_WQP-PJ302M_Horizontal | a PJ302M jack with slot holes
Jack_3.5mm_QingPu_WQP-PJ302M_Horizontal_CircularHoles | a PJ302M jack with round holes
PinHeader_2x05_P2.54mm_Vertical_EurorackPower | a 2x5 pin header with Eurorack power annotations
PinHeader_2x08_P2.54mm_Vertical_EurorackPower | a 2x8 pin header with Eurorack power annotations
Potentiometer_Alpha_RD901F-20_Single_Horizontal_CircularHoles | a horizontally mounted Alpha potentiometer
RCA-Phono_CUI-Devices_RCJ-02X_Vertical | a vertically mounted RCA phono connector
R_Axial_P7.62mm_Horizontal_LZX | a small resistor footprint made to look how they do on LZX Cadet PCBs
Switch_Toggle_Mountain-Switch_10TF230_Horizontal | a horizontally mounted SPDT toggle switch
misc_reference_for_test_and_whatever | three holes, not sure why I made this

Please feel free to use them as you'd like in your own projects. If they help you, I'm glad.
