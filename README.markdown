jwm_kicad_footprints_misc.pretty
================================

This is a collection of miscellaneous footprints for [KiCad](https://kicad.org). Currently, this is my only custom footprints library, but it's also a holding library before I can break footprints out into separate specialized libraries.

(You might also be interested in my related [misc symbols library](https://github.com/joem/jwm_kicad_symbols_misc) and [misc 3D models library](https://github.com/joem/jwm_kicad_3dmodels_misc.3dshapes) for KiCad.)

3D? Column Key:

- `K` means it uses a model from the KiCad library
- `C` means it uses a model found in [my misc 3D models library](https://github.com/joem/jwm_kicad_3dmodels_misc.3dshapes)
- `O` means it uses a model made by someone else that isn't part of the KiCad library (no preview included for these)

For an easy preview of what these footprints look like, look in the [images](images/) folder.

Please feel free to use these footprints as you'd like in your own projects. If they help you, I'm glad.
